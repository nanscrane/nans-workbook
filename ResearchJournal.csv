left,Agnieszka Pilat,"Polish Painter, 1973 - now","Agnieszka Pilat identifies herself as a painter, yet she takes machines as her subjects. The concepts in her paintings correlate 21st-century robotics and artificial intelligence with the steam-powered mechanisms of the Industrial Revolution, exploring the trajectory of mechanical life in the history of art creation. She perceives machines as distinct entities, acknowledging them not merely as mechanical means to produce art but as active participants in artistic creation. She regards her robots as apprentices, teaching them modern and ancient artistic languages through computer coding and enabling them to depict symbolic languages in the real world. To her, these symbols drawn in reality not only reveal their deep-rooted desire for connection (to their own knowledge systems) but also express their communication with human thoughts. Heterobota, exhibited at the NGV Triennial, invites viewers to observe the daily lives and interactions of three quadruped robots—Basia Spot, Omuzana Spot, and Bunny Spot—at their home. While viewing this exhibition, I pondered a question: Can machines possess their own thoughts? Can they have their own souls and lives? In 2C, we study physical computers, and these robots can also be considered as physical computers. By using AI to teach these physical computers human programming, could our mechanical plugins one day become intelligent beings as well? Furthermore, as the tools through which we express our thoughts, are they merely instruments for our artistic creation, or are they partners in creating art with us? These reflections, along with Agnieszka Pilat's understanding of machines, lead me to include her work in my research journal.",https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/zwc1qAImBHWLYXU.jpg,,"Heterobota, NGV TRIENNIAL, 2023",,https://www.pilatart.com/,"PhysicalComputer, Mechnies, Symbolic Languages, 2C"

His research focuses on the fluid relationships between the online and offline worlds, pioneering communal experiences between existence, symbols, and machines. In our studies in 2B, we delve into p5.js and utilize this programming language to create imaginative code. Many of Angelo Plessas' innovative and abstract websites are examples of new media art created with creative coding. He engages viewers by generating random graphics and allowing them to interact with these graphics (via mouse clicks or dragging), providing them with novel experiences. Examples include QuantaMirage.com, 2024, and AnimaLeggera.com, 2006.

left,Bridget Riley,"British artist, 1931 - now","Bridget Riley is a renowned artist famous for her op art. Many of her works revolve around visual illusions and perceptual art. I chose her 1961 piece, ""Study for Black to White Discs,"" as a reference. In this work, Riley moves away from pure black and white, exploring, in her words, ""the purest sense of tone."" Uniformly spaced, equally sized discs form a diamond grid. Each row introduces a gradient, transitioning from light to dark or from dark to light. By placing the darkest row off-center, Riley exploits the unstable, changing relationship between form and tone. The enlargement of the discs compared to the small-scale studies (Class 18) creates a perceptual effect of slowing down their movement. This method of altering perception through manipulation of color and pattern shape has inspired me. The theme of my workbook in 2A is ""dreambox,"" a magical box containing various items. I struggled with how to make my website visitors feel that it is a three-dimensional box filled with various items. Eventually, I made each side of my box gradient-colored and tried to make adjacent sides as closely related in color scheme as possible to create a sense of interconnectedness. I also used JavaScript to make the box rotate in the webpage (interactive to make the audience feel it is a 3D box). However, my technical skills are limited, and I need further improvement. Perhaps I should be more careful in choosing colors as well.",https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/BPp8Tslw6WCJun4.jpg,,"Study for Black to White Discs, 1961",,https://bridget-riley.publications.britishart.yale.edu/,"Op Art, Modern Art, Hard-edge Painting, 2A"

Many of their works revolve around the theme of the complexity of human, societal, and natural phenomena. The studio's primary research areas are multimedia installations and performances, seeking connections between light, space, sound, and movement. Among the many works of this company, I chose two exhibitions with different themes. One is Onirica, which studies and interprets different dreams using data from different stages of human sleep, such as EEG, EOG, and EMG. The other is Trust, which trains computer neural networks using the Consumer Confidence Index (ICS) to generate emotions of humans at different time periods. Both exhibitions are actually very rational. They use real data to help computer neural networks learn and generate patterns representing this data, which can indeed be called a form of data visualization. I chose this company because when I watched these exhibitions, I always felt like I was in a computer space. Patterns of visualized data appear on the walls, floors, and ceilings of the exhibition, and as the audience walks through the exhibition, do they also faintly feel like they are traversing through a giant computer neural network? (Just like walking inside a computer) This influenced some of the concepts in my 2C workbook, where I also want to use straightforward imagery to tell my audience what I am doing.",https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/LFi58XrGRyAUfHm.jpg,https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/n6lmOuLVawX8x7b.jpg,"ONIRICA (), 2023","TRUST, 2022",https://www.fuseworks.it/,"ComputerArt,multimedia installations and performances, 2C"
leftDoubleImage,HAROLD COHEN: AARON,"British artist, 1928 - 2016","AARON is the earliest artistic creation of artificial intelligence, created by the British artist Harold Cohen. Over several decades of evolution, Cohen designed drawing instruments and a painting machine specifically for AARON to output drawings based on computer commands. The learning evolution of AARON is also quite fascinating. In the late 1960s, when AARON was first used for painting, it began by creating drawings of various shapes and curves, varying in size, much like a child's drawing (e.g., the untitled, 1982). Indeed, children's drawing processes were Cohen's initial inspiration; he trained AARON to start from simple shapes and gradually progress to more complex ones. Later on, AARON started depicting human figures, and after the 1980s, it was used to paint abstract forms. Despite not storing specific data on plant groups, AARON could generate plant-like forms based on patterns formed by plant sizes and leaf formations. I chose this example because it truly showcases a fascinating journey of a physical computer device evolving into an autonomous painter through AI learning. However, it raises the question: Did it unconsciously generate patterns through imitation due to being fed with sufficient data by humans, or did it truly begin to contemplate how to draw patterns on its own? Thus, I consider it as a reference for my research on 2C.",https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/CEtPGaxScb29Nsr.jpg,https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/fM64m8Sgvh39dcy.jpg," Untitled, 1982"," AARON Gijon, 2007",https://whitney.org/exhibitions/harold-cohen-aaron?section=3&subsection=1#exhibition-about,"PhysicalComputer, ComputerArt, 2C"
leftDoubleImage,Lauren Lee McCarthy,"Artist, USA, creator of p5.js","As the creator of P5.JS, how could we not mention the works of Lauren Lee McCarthy? This artist's perspective is both sharp and unique, and I particularly admire her exploration of communication between people and human emotions. In ""someone,"" Lauren Lee McCarthy uses laptops as surveillance tools to monitor four participants. Visitors can call upon and monitor the homes of these four individuals through computers set up in the exhibition. The identity of the visitors can range from mere observers to communicators with the inhabitants of the homes via smart devices, showcasing the diverse personalities of each individual. In ""The Changing room,"" Lauren Lee McCarthy creates a space where visitors' emotions are manifested through interactions with smart devices. She creatively visualizes emotions through code, presenting abstract feelings visually within the room. During 2B, we've learned and explored numerous creative codes related to P5.JS, many of which are abstract, expressing ideas through graphics and lines (e.g., drawing portraits of classmates!). So, in reality, some of Lauren Lee McCarthy's ideas have been intertwined throughout my learning journey in 2B?",https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/8VrMR15Y4NpfAcX.png,https://s2.loli.net/2024/05/11/mwKTvf7EeV9hRIc.jpg,"Someone, 2020","The Changing Room, 2021",https://lauren-mccarthy.com/,"CreativeCoding, P5.js, Interactive Installation, 2B"

I particularly admire some of his works since 1973, where he used the polychromed hypercubes to generate two-dimensional symbolic graphic structures. I chose his print, p-197, which delves into the study of geometricism and the use of symbols and systems in art, which I find truly fascinating. He employs computer programs to draw these geometric forms, with each point of the cube and its rotation governed by equations within his computer program. This two-dimensional representation of multidimensional space is intriguing, evoking the beauty of geometric shapes while challenging our perception of space, dimension, and form. Therefore, in the homepage of my 2B project, I also utilized a matrix of geometric shapes, allowing them to change color upon mouse hover.

As photographers were prompted to ponder a key question: ""In the 21st century, where cities represent dominant human ecosystems, what does life in a megacity entail?"" So, these photographs, themed around urban populations, prompt us to contemplate the exploration of different life systems and lifestyles. Despite people being in varying life states, whether impoverished or affluent, busy or leisurely, they are all intricately woven into their local life systems, firmly embedded as part of the system.
